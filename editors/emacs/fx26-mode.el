;;; fx26-mode.el --- Editing FX-26, and a REPL for it  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Part of fixpt (https://github.com/pnkfelix/fixpt).

;;; Commentary:

;; A major mode for FX-26 source (`.fx' files): font-lock for its forms,
;; kinds, effects and regions; indentation as the repository writes it;
;; a REPL (`run-fx26'), into which a definition, a region or the file can
;; be sent; `flymake' running both of fixpt's checkers as you type; and
;; `eldoc' showing the type and effect the last check found for the
;; global at point.
;;
;; The REPL runs `fixpt --dialect fx26 --emacs repl'.  `--emacs' turns off
;; the continuation prompt and accepts `,at FILE LINE COL' before a form,
;; so that its errors name where it was sent from; in the REPL buffer,
;; `compilation-shell-minor-mode' makes them links.
;;
;; To use it:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/Dev/Rust/fixpt/editors/emacs")
;;   (require 'fx26-mode)

;;; Code:

(require 'comint)
