;;; BOYER -- a term rewriter and tautology checker: the Boyer-Moore
;;; theorem prover's rewriting, on a fixed theorem.
;;;
;;; From the SML/NJ benchmark suite.
;;; From MLton's benchmark suite (benchmark/tests/boyer.sml, commit
;;; aa2fd1ad9b91), ported to FX-26. MLton's driver was not fetched; the
;;; iteration count, 30 proofs, is this port's. MLton's `doit n` runs n.
;;; Answer: #t, the theorem proved (the original's `testit` prints
;;; "Proved!").
;;;
;;; What changed:
;;; - A head's equality, which SML's `=` on the record {name, props} makes
;;;   a comparison of the name and of the `props` ref, is a comparison of
;;;   the names (`string=?`): FX-26 has no equality of refs, and `get`
;;;   makes one head per name, so the two agree. Terms are compared by
;;;   `term-equal?`, written out, where SML's `=` is structural.
;;; - Exceptions abort to a prompt of the handler that catches them, each a
;;;   tag of its own. `failure` (raised by `get_binding`) is caught by two
;;;   handlers, whose values are of different types (a term in
;;;   `apply_subst`, a substitution in `unify1`), so `get_binding` is
;;;   written twice, one for each. `Unify` is caught only by
;;;   `rewrite_with_lemmas`, whose `handle unify =>` catches everything
;;;   (a variable pattern); nothing else can reach it, so its tag carries
;;;   the unit value.
;;; - The rules' `CProp (name, [a, b])` is `(cp2 name a b)`, a procedure
;;;   making the same list and `CProp` (`cp0` … `cp6`, by arity).
;;;   Likewise the main term's `Prop (get "f", [...])` is `(p1 "f" ...)`.
;;;   SML's `get` is `get-head`, since FX-26's `get` reads a ref.
;;; - A head, SML's record {name, props}, is a datatype of one variant,
;;;   `mk-head`, taken apart by `tagcase`, and `headname` is written in
;;;   place: with a product, taken apart by `extract`, a call of a
;;;   procedure whose body extracts (`headname`, `truep`) made the caller
;;;   decline register code, so it ran as cellular code, and an abort from
;;;   native code found no prompt (reported). The datatype takes the term
;;;   type as a parameter, since two datatypes cannot mention each other.
;;; - `tautologyp` on a `Prop` of other than three arguments, where SML
;;;   raises Match, is false; it is never reached (the proof succeeds).
