;;; fixpt conformance golden generator -- FX-87.
;;;
;;; Drives GiffordHistory's ported reference implementation
;;; (fx-lang/fx87/private/impl.rkt) the way erase.lisp's own TOP-LEVEL does
;;; for an ordinary expression -- PARSE-EXP then DESC-OF-EXP -- and prints
;;; the resulting (type . effect) through the same CREATE-FINITE-DEXP +
;;; UNPARSE-D-NODE pipeline SHOW-TYPE-AND-EFFECT uses.  CREATE-FINITE-DEXP
;;; is not optional: FX-87 builds genuinely CIRCULAR type structures with
;;; SET-CAR!, and it is what re-finitises them into DLETREC form.
;;;
;;; VALUES come from a second source.  The FX-87 port installs no evaluator
;;; (machdep.rkt's FX-EVAL-HOOK errors by design), so each well-typed form is
;;; also written to a temporary `#lang fx87-hashlang` module and run -- the
;;; archive's evaluating path, and the one its own test-cross-validate.rkt
;;; uses.  That path shares the checker with impl.rkt but has its own pair
;;; conversion, hygiene handling and runtime primitives, so a value produced
;;; there is evidence about the language rather than a restatement of the
;;; type.
;;;
;;; This makes regeneration slow -- one Racket module compile per case -- which
;;; is why the goldens are committed and this script is run deliberately.
;;;
;;; Usage: racket fx87-golden.rkt <input.fx-cases> <output.expected>
