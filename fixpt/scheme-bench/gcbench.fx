;;; GCBENCH -- John Ellis and Pete Kovac's garbage collector benchmark.
;;;
;;; From Larceny's R7RS benchmarks (test/Benchmarking/R7RS/src/gcbench.scm),
;;; ported to FX-26. Larceny's input: 1 iteration of (gcbench 20).
;;; Answer: 0 (Larceny's checker accepts any result; this port's value is 0
;;; when the final sanity check passes, where the original would print
;;; "Failed", and 1 otherwise).
;;;
;;; This is adapted from a benchmark written by John Ellis and Pete Kovac
;;; of Post Communications.
;;; It was modified by Hans Boehm of Silicon Graphics.
;;; It was translated into Scheme by William D Clinger of Northeastern Univ.
;;;
;;;      This is no substitute for real applications.  No actual application
;;;      is likely to behave in exactly this way.  However, this benchmark was
;;;      designed to be more representative of real applications than other
;;;      Java GC benchmarks of which we are aware.
;;;      It attempts to model those properties of allocation requests that
;;;      are important to current GC techniques.
;;;      It is designed to be used either to obtain a single overall performance
;;;      number, or to give a more detailed estimate of how collector
;;;      performance varies with object lifetimes.  It prints the time
;;;      required to allocate and collect balanced binary trees of various
;;;      sizes.  Smaller trees result in shorter object lifetimes.  Each cycle
;;;      allocates roughly the same amount of memory.
;;;      Two data structures are kept around during the entire process, so
;;;      that the measured performance is representative of applications
;;;      that maintain some live in-memory data.  One of these is a tree
;;;      containing many pointers.  The other is a large array containing
;;;      double precision floating point numbers.  Both should be of comparable
;;;      size.
;;;
;;; What the port changed, and why:
;;;
;;; - Nodes. The original's node is a record of four mutable fields, left,
;;;   right, i and j, whose left and right are 0 in an empty node: here a
;;;   bloblet of four fields, its children `(union int node)`, 0 in an empty
;;;   node, one object as Larceny's record is (2026-10-07; until then three
;;;   pairs, ((left . right) . (i . j)), an empty node's children nil, since
;;;   FX-26 had no union of an int and a node: 1.18 s natively, the record
;;;   0.60 once made in line, `DONE.md` §57). `populate` stores the new
;;;   children it then fills, where the original reads them back out of the
;;;   node, which would need a test of their shape. `(eq? longLivedTree
;;;   '())` is `null?`.
;;; - The long-lived array. The original fills half of a vector of
;;;   kArraySize elements with the inexact reals 1/(i+1), and checks one of
;;;   them at the end; the reals are ballast, live data for the collector to
;;;   keep, and nothing is computed with them. FX-26 has no floating point,
;;;   and the port does not pretend to: element i holds instead a new
;;;   `(ref int)` of i+1, a small heap object per element as a boxed flonum
;;;   is, and the final check asks whether element n holds n+1. The unfilled
;;;   half shares one object, as it shares the constant 0.0.
;;; - The inner procedures of `gcbench`, which close over its parameters,
;;;   are top-level procedures taking them as arguments; `do` loops are
;;;   recursive procedures; `expt` of 2 is a loop.
;;; - The displays (progress lines, "Failed") are left out: FX-26 has no
;;;   output. The result of the check is the value instead.
