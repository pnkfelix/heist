;;; LSEQ -- Lazy sequence benchmark.
;;;
;;; Uses an example taken from the SRFI 41 document.
;;;
;;; From Larceny's R7RS benchmarks (test/Benchmarking/R7RS/src/lseq.scm),
;;; ported to FX-26. Larceny's input: 1 iteration of (go 250).
;;; Answer: (135 324 351).
;;;
;;; FX-26 has no (scheme generator) or (scheme lseq). `make-iota-generator`
;;; and `make-range-generator` are Larceny's (SRFI 121's reference
;;; implementation, lib/SRFI/srfi/121.body.scm), closures over variables
;;; they assign, here refs; `generator->lseq`, `lseq-car` and `lseq-cdr`
;;; are Larceny's too (SRFI 127's, lib/SRFI/srfi/127.body.scm): an lseq is
;;; a pair whose cdr, until `lseq-cdr` realizes it, is the generator. What
;;; differs, and why:
;;; - An lseq's cdr is a list or a procedure, which `procedure?` tells
;;;   apart: a union, `(union lseq gen)`, which `typecase` takes apart
;;;   (2026-10-07; until then a sum, `(seq rest)` or `(gen g)`, one made as
;;;   well as each pair realized: 4.0 s natively, the union 2.0 s once
;;;   `procedure?` was in line, `TODO.md` §56).
;;; - The end of a generator, Scheme's eof object, is a fixnum none of
;;;   these generators yields: the least one. A generator is then a
;;;   procedure of no arguments returning an int, as in Larceny, where the
;;;   eof object is also an immediate; `eof-object?` compares with it.
;;; - The benchmark counts n with `(make-iota-generator +inf.0 1)`, a count
;;;   that never runs out; FX-26 has no flonums, so the count is the
;;;   greatest fixnum, which runs out no sooner than 2^60 values.
;;; - `set!` of the local `count` is a ref, `do` a named loop, and
;;;   `call-with-current-continuation` is `cwcc`.
