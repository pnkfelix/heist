//! The Core IR: what every front end produces and every engine consumes.
//!
//! Scheme, FX-87 and FX-91 all funnel through this. That is the whole economy
//! of the design — the FX front ends are front ends, exactly as `erase.lisp`
//! and `code.scm` were front ends onto Scheme, so they inherit the
//! interpreter, the compiler, heap dumping and single-binary builds without
//! any of it being written twice.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! An arena of nodes indexed by [`NodeId`], not a tree of boxes. Larceny's
//! `pass1`/`pass2` annotate lambda nodes in place with their reference,
//! assignment and free-variable sets; an arena is how you do that in Rust
//! without either interior mutability or rebuilding the tree on every pass.
//! Analyses live in dense side tables keyed by the same indices.
//!
//! The grammar is deliberately small — closer to Larceny's `pass1` output than
//! to Scheme:
//!
//! ```text
//! E ::= Const | Ref | GlobalRef | Set | GlobalSet
//!     | If | Seq | Let | Fix | Lambda | App | PrimCall
//! ```
//!
//! Everything else (`cond`, `case`, `do`, named `let`, `when`, `and`, …) is
//! gone by the time it gets here, having been expanded by the front end.
//!
//! # Constants and the collector
//!
//! Quoted data are real heap values, so they must be traced. They live in
//! [`Program::consts`], an ordinary `Vec<Value>` that the engine hands to
//! [`Heap::collect`](fixpt_heap::Heap::collect) as part of its root set at
//! every safepoint. Keeping them in a Rust `Vec` rather than a heap vector
//! means adding a constant never reallocates anything on the heap, and the
//! rooting is visible at the call site instead of hidden.
