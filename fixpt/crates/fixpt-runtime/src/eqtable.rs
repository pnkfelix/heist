//! Tables keyed by identity (`eqtable`, PLAN.md Q5), hashed by address.
//!
//! A collection moves objects, so an address hash goes stale at one. Each
//! table is stamped with the heap's count of collections (minor and major)
//! when its keys were last hashed; an operation that finds the count moved
//! rehashes every entry first. That is Larceny's design
//! (`src/Lib/Common/hashtable.sch`) in its simplest form: one stamp, not a
//! tablet for old keys and one for young, which would rehash only the young
//! after a minor collection. Rehashing relinks the entries it has, so it
//! allocates nothing, and allocation never collects outside a safepoint, so
//! nothing moves during an operation.
//!
//! A table is a bloblet of kind `eqtable`, its fields the stamp, the count
//! and the buckets (which it prints only the count of); `buckets` a vector of
//! chains; an entry a vector `[key, value, next]`, `next` another entry or
//! `#f`. The type is opaque to programs (`check::EQTABLE`), so nothing else
//! sees this layout.
