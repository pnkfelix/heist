//! Continuations that cross machines (`TODO.md` §93): native code calls
//! cellular code it declined to compile, which calls native code, and so
//! on, each machine with frames of its own. A capture up to a prompt that
//! one of the machines out from the capturing one set takes each machine's
//! frames in turn, innermost first, through the calls between them.
//!
//! While a machine is in a call of another machine's code it is a
//! *boundary* here, innermost last; the calls nest strictly, so the
//! innermost boundary is the call of the machine running. Each segment of
//! a crossing continuation is a continuation of its own machine's frames
//! with the segment inside it as its *inner* one: given a value, the
//! segment puts its frames back, then calls its inner one with the value,
//! where the call between the two machines was, and resumes with what that
//! returns.
