//! Running FX-87 programs: check, erase, evaluate.
//!
//! `type-and-eval` in the reference is `desc-of-exp` followed by
//! `(fx-eval (erase-type node))`, and this is the same two steps onto this
//! project's engines. Nothing about FX-87 reaches the evaluator: by the time
//! the Scheme session sees anything, the types have been erased and what is
//! left is a Scheme program.
//!
//! The erased form goes across as *text* and is re-read, for the reason FX-91's
//! does: the FX-87 checker and the Scheme session intern symbols separately, so
//! passing syntax directly would mix two symbol spaces silently. Writing and
//! re-reading also makes the generated code inspectable, which is most of
//! debugging a code generator.
