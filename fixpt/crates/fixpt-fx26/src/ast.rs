//! Descriptions and expressions.
//!
//! **Descriptions** are FX's word for what an expression is *described by* —
//! regions, effects and types, one kind each (`K ::= region | effect | type`).
//! They live in an arena so that a recursive type from `dletrec` can be a
//! cycle of ids, as FX-87's circular types were cycles of conses.
//!
//! **Effects** are kept in normal form: a set of atoms. `pure` is the empty
//! set and `maxeff` is union, so `(maxeff e (maxeff e pure))` and `e` are the
//! same value — the normalisation PLDI '89 relies on when it says the latent
//! effect of `twice`'s inner lambda is `e` (p. 3).
