;;; The checker, in FX-26: what has been said of a type binder, as bounds

;;; checker's `infer.rs`, `Bounds`). At least what the arguments are,
;;; joined; at most what the context expects, met; and, inside something
;;; mutable, so invariant, exactly what is there. Where the bounds meet, or
;;; it is exact, the binder is known, and tells the arguments still to be
;;; checked what they are; until then its solution is the exact type, else
;;; the lower bound, else the upper. After `check-subtype.fx`, before
;;; `check-infer.fx`, whose `k-unify-var` keeps them.

;; Its types, those it uses of the files before it, and the signatures of
