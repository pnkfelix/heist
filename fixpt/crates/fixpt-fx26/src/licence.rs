//! Effects as licences: what a speculation driver may let run.
//!
//! A licence is effect masking, relative to an observer. Masking asks what
//! anything outside *an expression* can observe, and answers from types:
//! whatever the free variables and the result can reach. A licence asks what
//! the *user's program* can observe of code a driver runs early, repeatedly,
//! or not at all. The answer has the same shape. Effects on regions the
//! program cannot name are invisible to it.
//!
//! So an effect is licensed when, masked for that observer, nothing is left
//! but allocation. Every atom must be
//!
//! * an allocation, anywhere — a new object is invisible until something
//!   that can see it is handed it, and that would be a read or a write; or
//! * a read, a write or a control effect on a region the observer cannot
//!   name.
//!
//! An effect variable is never licensed: it could be anything.
//!
//! Which regions the observer cannot name is not asserted by the driver. It
//! is established by construction, in either of two ways:
//!
//! * **Fresh regions.** Inference instantiates a region nothing constrains
//!   with a fresh, uninterned one, and masking then removes effects on it.
//!   The REPL's speculation relies on this: it owns no region, and runs an
//!   expression early only if masking left nothing but allocation.
//! * **Regions given.** Code that is a `plambda` over regions, which whoever
//!   makes it gives, can name no other: in its type, each entry point's
//!   effect is on those binders, whichever regions they become, and on no
//!   region of its own choosing (`Checker::parametric_licence`). The eager
//!   reader and the parser are such code: module files of the reader's
//!   regions (`(module-parameters …)`), made by the front end at the regions
//!   it names (`reader.fx`). Their effects stay visible in their types, as
//!   they must, because the driver holds their states; but they can touch
//!   only what they made or were handed, so nothing the user writes is
//!   touched, and the user is handed nothing of theirs.
//!
//! Two things a licence needs that masking does not: running early may not
//! terminate, and may fail, and neither is an effect. So a speculative run
//! has a step budget of its own, and a failure is shown, not raised.
