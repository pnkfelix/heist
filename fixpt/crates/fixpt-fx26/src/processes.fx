;; The scheduler of processes and `par` (`docs/fx26.md`, "Processes and
;; `par`"): a module file built in, which the forms `spawn`, `send`,
;; `receive`, `self`, `par`, `race`, `pselect`, `icell-get` and
;; `icell-put!` call, each through this file's one value, loaded once. The checkers give those
;; forms types of their own (`Checker::library_type`); the types written
;; here are this file's, in which a task may do anything (`any`): what a
;; program that loads this file itself sees, which lets it do nothing a
;; form could not.
;;
;; A task is a thunk the scheduler runs under its prompt (`run-task`). It
;; waits by capturing the rest of itself up to the prompt, handing a thunk
;; that resumes it to what it waits for, and aborting (`suspend`). Only the
;; first task, the program's own, runs the scheduler (`drain`): when it
;; waits, and after each `spawn`, `send` or `icell-put!` it makes, so that
;; whatever can run has run before the form that made it so ends. Each
;; task has a stack of places of its own (`fixpt_heap`'s tasks), and the
;; scheduler runs as the first. The runtime's part is `%sched`'s
;; operations (`fixpt_runtime::sched`), by number.
