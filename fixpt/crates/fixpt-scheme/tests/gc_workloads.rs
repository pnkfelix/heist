//! Collector workloads, ported from Larceny's `test/GC`.
//!
//! The `gc-stress` feature answers one question — does every safepoint hand the
//! collector a complete root set — and it answers it with whatever allocation
//! the rest of the suite happens to do. That is a narrow question. It says
//! nothing about whether long-lived data survives repeated collection intact,
//! whether large objects are reclaimed, or whether a copying collector
//! preserves sharing rather than quietly duplicating shared structure.
//!
//! Larceny's `test/GC` directory exists precisely because those are different
//! questions, and `permsort.sch` states the taxonomy outright:
//!
//! ```text
//!    perm8            storage allocation
//!    Tenperm8         storage allocation and garbage collection
//!    sumperms         sequential traversal
//!    mergesort        side effects
//! ```
//!
//! …while `grow.sch` notes it is "particularly nice to test the large-object
//! space for space leaks". These are ports of those, turned from benchmarks
//! into assertions: each one checks a *result* (so a collector that corrupts
//! live data fails rather than merely running) and, where the workload is about
//! memory rather than arithmetic, a heap-occupancy property.
//!
//! Sources: `larceny/test/GC/{gcbench0,grow,permsort}.sch`.
