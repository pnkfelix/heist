//! Lexical syntax profiles — what makes the same reader serve three languages.
//!
//! The FX dialects are not Scheme with extra forms; they differ at the
//! character level, and the archive is explicit about it:
//!
//! * FX-87's own reader (`fx-extensions.lisp`, reproduced in
//!   `fx87-hashlang/lang/reader.rkt`) reads `#t`, `#f` and `#u` as **symbols**,
//!   because `syntax.lisp`'s `literal-bool?` tests `(memv (caddr node) '(|#f|
//!   |#t|))` — they were never Scheme booleans. It also needs `[` and `]` as
//!   ordinary symbol characters, since `intern-[p]defines?` and
//!   `free-[d]vars` are single Common Lisp symbols.
//!
//! * FX-91 reads `#t`/`#f` as real booleans but `#u` as the **uppercase**
//!   symbol `#U`, because `standard.scm:90` builds it with `string->symbol` at
//!   load time, before any case-folding reader parameter could apply.
//!
//! * FX-91 also has `[e dx1 … dxn]` as sugar for `(proj e dx1 … dxn)` (report
//!   §2.4.9). The reader macro that implemented it is not in the recovered
//!   archive — `sugar.scm:7` only *refers* to it — and the Racket port cannot
//!   reach the feature at all, because Racket's reader gives `[e d]` and
//!   `(e d)` the identical datum. Here the reader is ours, so it works.
//!
//! * Both dialects fold symbol case; Scheme does not.
//!
//! * FX-26, this project's own dialect, has a profile of its own rather than
//!   borrowing one: Scheme's, except that `#u` is also the unit value and
//!   `[`/`]` are reserved — FX-91 used them for projection sugar, and FX-26
//!   has not yet decided what they are for.

/// How `[` and `]` are treated.
