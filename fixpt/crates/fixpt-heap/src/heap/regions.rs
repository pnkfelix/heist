//! Regions: what a `letrena` or `letreap` allocates in (PLAN.md, "Regions
//! that end"). Each region is chunks of its own, past the two semispaces,
//! all given back when it ends. The two kinds differ in what the collector
//! does with them:
//! - an arena's chunks never move, and the collector traces them all as
//!   roots, so what they point to in the heap lives;
//! - a reap's are collected with the heap: what is reachable in it is
//!   copied into new chunks of its own, and the old chunks given back.
//!
//! Chunks, not one stack of words with a mark per region: a region may be
//! allocated in while a newer one is live (a closure over an older region's
//! allocation, called in a newer one's body), and a stack would free that
//! allocation when the newer one ended. Within one task, regions end newest
//! first, since a body ends before the one around it and cannot be resumed
//! once ended (the checker allows no `comefrom` in it); so each task has a
//! stack of the regions it entered, and ending one ends any newer of its
//! own that an escape left behind.
//!
//! Tasks (FX-26's processes and `par`'s branches; `docs/fx26.md`,
//! "Processes") interleave, so the order holds only within each: task A
//! enters `r1` and waits, B enters `r2`, A leaves `r1`, and `r2` must not
//! end. So a handle is not a position but a slot of its own, numbered from
//! the lowest free, and each task's stack holds the slots it entered. The
//! heap has one task current, 0 until another is made current; entering,
//! leaving and counting regions are the current task's (task Q1 of
//! `docs/research/actors-and-distribution.md`).
//!
//! A reference to what a region held may linger after it ends, in a
//! frame's dead slot say, where the collector will find it. It never
//! follows one into an arena, so an arena's chunks are reused as soon as it
//! ends. It would follow one into a reap, so it follows only references into
//! a live reap's own chunks, and an ended reap's chunks are not reused until
//! a collection has found no reference into them: until then they are in
//! quarantine, their pages given back to the system. The reaps' chunks come
//! from an area of their own.
//!
//! Allocation goes to a region only while a primitive asks for it
//! (`Heap::in_region`); anything too big for a chunk, or once its area is
//! full, goes to the heap as it would have. Either is sound: the heap is
//! only slower to reclaim.
