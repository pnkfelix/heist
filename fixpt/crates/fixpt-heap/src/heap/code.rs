//! The code area (`docs/object-model.md`, "A collected code area"):
//! bloblets that never move, past the regions' areas, for code, which is
//! pointed into by raw addresses and so must stay where it is put. The
//! collector traces them as it meets them, marking instead of copying, and
//! sweeps the rest into a free list after, so code no longer reachable is
//! reclaimed.
//!
//! The area is always walkable from its start, header to header: a free
//! block is written as a raw bloblet whose suffix covers it. Allocation is
//! first fit from the free list, else from the end of what has been walked.
