# mllang-bench: ML benchmarks, and their ports to FX-26

Reference points, not part of the per-commit `fixpt bench`. The sources
were downloaded on 2026-09-29, verbatim, at pinned commits; provenance and
licences are in `SOURCES.md`:

- `mlton-benchmark/`: MLton's benchmark suite (`benchmark/tests`), the de
  facto standard SML set, much of it from the SML/NJ suite.
- `ocaml-classic/`: the classic OCaml benchmark programs from OCaml's own
  testsuite, each with its expected output (`.reference`).
- `sandmark-benchmarksgame/`: the Benchmarks Game programs from Sandmark.

The ports are in `fx/mlton/`, `fx/ocaml/` and `fx/benchmarksgame/`. Each
file's header gives its source, what the port changed and why, its count
and its answer. MLton's driver, with its per-benchmark counts, was not
fetched, so the MLton counts are ours, chosen for about 1 to 3 s of
native run time; so are the OCaml counts where the originals' were too
small. Where an original prints its result, the port's value pins it: a
count, a checksum, or (for `kb` and `sorts`) a hash of the output equal to
the hash of the `.reference` file.

To run one as machine code:

```
fixpt eval --step-limit none mllang-bench/fx/mlton/NAME.fx   # on the fastest machine here
```

## Ported: 46

Every port passes both checkers, runs natively, and agrees with the
program lowered to Scheme. Times are one native run each, alone, on
2026-09-29 (`DLXSimulator`, `md5`, `pidigits`, `pidigits5`,
`psdes-random` and `smith-normal-form` on 2026-09-30), wall clock
including about 1.8 to 3.5 s of start-up. Start-up is about 0.5 s since
2026-09-30 (the front end's checker and compilers are no longer also
loaded lowered): subtract about 2.2 s from a time here for today's.
The four float ports (2026-10-12: `mandelbrot`, `matrix-multiply`,
`nbody`, `spectralnorm2`) are timed with today's start-up, about 0.5 s;
since §91 (2026-10-12) an `f64` in a frame slot is raw, not a heap box
(they were 1.85, 1.85, 3.32 and 2.07 s); an `f64` passed to or returned
from a call is boxed still.

`md5` and `psdes-random` emulated Word32's bit operations with byte
tables until FX-26 had fixed-width integers; they now use `u32`, as
`DLXSimulator` does, and give the same answers. Their counts were kept, so
their times are now mostly start-up: at 100 times the count (2000 blocks,
30M words), `md5` computes in about 0.6 s where the tables took 2.7 s,
and `psdes-random` in 2.5 s where they took 5.6 s.
