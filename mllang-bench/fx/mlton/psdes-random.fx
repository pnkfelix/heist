;;; PSDES-RANDOM -- a pseudo-DES hash as a random number generator
;;; (Numerical Recipes in C, page 302), summing the words it makes.
;;;
;;; Written by Stephen Weeks (sweeks@sweeks.com).
;;; From MLton's benchmark suite (benchmark/tests/psdes-random.sml, commit
;;; aa2fd1ad9b91), ported to FX-26. Iteration count (ours; MLton's driver
;;; was not fetched, and the file itself ends with `Main.doit 2`): 1 call of
;;; `once`, whose loop makes 300000 words, not the original's 150000000.
;;; Answer: 2419669511 (0wx90393A07), the sum of the words modulo 2^32 (for
;;; 150000000 words the original checks for 0wx132B1B67 = 321592167; this
;;; count's sum was computed by a Python transcription of the same code,
;;; which also gives 0wx132B1B67 for 150000000).
;;;
;;; Word32 is `u32`, whose arithmetic wraps as Word32's does: `+`, `*`,
;;; `xorb`, `andb`, `orb`, `notb`, `>>` and `<<` are `u32+`, `u32*`,
;;; `u32-xor`, `u32-and`, `u32-or`, `u32-not`, `u32-shr` and `u32-shl`.
;;; A constant is a literal where a u32 is expected, else `int->u32` of
;;; an int. The answer is the sum's `u32->int`. (Until FX-26 had `u32`,
;;; this port did the same with ints masked to 32 bits, `xorb` a byte at a
;;; time through a table; that emulation was most of what it measured.)
;;; `once`'s loop does not check the sum (the original raises Fail "bug"
;;; if it differs); it returns it.
