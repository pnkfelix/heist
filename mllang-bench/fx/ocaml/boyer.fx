;;; BOYER -- the Boyer-Moore theorem prover's rewriter and tautology
;;; checker, proving a lemma after rewriting it with 106 lemmas.
;;;
;;; From OCaml's classic test programs (testsuite/tests/misc/boyer.ml, ocaml
;;; commit 7da997d28b1a), ported to FX-26. The original proves the term 10
;;; times and prints "Proved!" (the reference output) or "Cannot prove!".
;;; The port does those 10 proofs `iterations` = 3 times, the lemmas made
;;; once, and its value is the number of proofs that succeeded. Answer: 30
;;; (with `iterations` 1, 10: the reference's "Proved!").
;;;
;;; What the port changes:
;;; - The `head` record, with its mutable `props`, is a product whose
;;;   `props` field is a ref. OCaml compares heads with `==`; FX-26 has no
;;;   physical equality, so the port compares their names, which `get`
;;;   (here `get-head`) keeps unique, so that it means the same. The
;;;   structural `=` on terms (`List.mem`, and a binding compared with a
;;;   term) is `term=?`, heads again compared by name.
;;; - A compiler workaround: the names are compared by `string=?` written
;;;   out where heads are compared. Calling a procedure `same-head?` that
;;;   does it made the native run fail, "abort: no prompt for this tag",
;;;   where the cellular and lowered runs do not.
;;; - Exceptions: `failwith "unbound"` and `raise Unify`, each caught by a
;;;   `try` whose value is a term or a substitution, are aborts to two
;;;   prompt tags, `failure` and `unify-exn`; a prompt's body gives back an
;;;   `outcome`, a sum with a variant for each type a `try` gives, and its
;;;   handler `(failed)`. The prompts nest as deep as the original's `try`s
;;;   (`rewrite_with_lemmas` rewrites inside its `try`). `assert false` is
;;;   a `failwith` no prompt catches: an error, which never happens.
;;; - The lemmas, `CProp`/`CVar` constructor expressions in the original,
;;;   are built with `c0` .. `c6` (a `CProp` of that many arguments) and
;;;   `cv`, mechanically translated. `List.map` and `List.mem` are written
;;;   here; `cterm_to_term` maps the arguments before it gets the head,
;;;   in the order OCaml evaluates a constructor's arguments.
;;; - `apply_subst` gives back the whole term for an unbound variable, as
;;;   the original does.
