//! Checking the kernel: a type and an effect for every expression.
//!
//! The rules are KFX's (PLDI '89, p. 3), n-ary as FX-87 writes them:
//!
//! * a variable, a literal, a `lambda` and a `plambda` are pure;
//! * an application's effect is the operator's, the arguments', and the
//!   operator's latent effect, combined;
//! * a `plambda`'s body must be pure;
//! * `proj` substitutes descriptions for a `poly`'s binders.
//!
//! **Masking** is applied at every expression that combines effects —
//! application, `lambda` (whose masked body effect becomes the latent
//! effect), `let`, `letrec`, `begin`, `if`, `proj` — as FX-87's reference does
//! (`erase-effect`, called from `desc-of-begin`, `-lambda`, `-letrec`, `-app`
//! in `type-check.lisp`). The rule for each region `r` of an effect:
//!
//! * if `r` appears in the type of a free variable, everything on `r` stays;
//! * otherwise everything on `r` goes — except that when `r` appears in the
//!   result type, `(alloc r)` stays (FX-87: the cell escapes), and so do
//!   `(goto r)` and `(comefrom r)` (PLDI '89, p. 6: a control effect is masked
//!   only if the expression neither imports variables nor returns values whose
//!   types mention `r` — stricter than FX-87's rule for reads and writes, and
//!   p. 7 shows why).
//!
//! **Prompts** delimit control on their tag's region, under a condition of
//! their own: see `synth_prompt`.
