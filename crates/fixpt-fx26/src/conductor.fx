;;; The conductor (`TODO.md` §68): each module of the front end made once,

;;; expression (`load-input`), what makes the module of the modules it
;;; takes, each typed by its signature; the modules of the files not
;;; converted yet are the top-level ones of the files before this. Every
;;; load of a file is one value, so loading it here costs nothing more.
;;; Last of the front end. The modules are made inside one `let*`, so that
;;; only what Rust calls of them is named at top level: a module bound at
;;; top level has its whole type shown, and the types of modules are large.
