;;; be made (`c-twins`, `c-standard-twins`), and its specialized copies, as
;;; the plan says (`c-make-copies`); then each twin, its register code, in
;;; order, by the register compiler (`r-register-code`, `r-standard-word`),
;;; which makes no word. As the Rust compiler's `form_twins`. After the
;;; register compiler, which the stack compiler no longer calls; before the
;;; program loop (`compile-programs.fx`), which calls this.
