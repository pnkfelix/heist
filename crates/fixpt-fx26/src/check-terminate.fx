;;; ------------------------------------------------- well-founded recursion
;;; Which recursive groups need not say `spin`: size-change termination
;;; (Lee, Jones and Ben-Amram, POPL 2001), as `terminate.rs` does it. Each
;;; call within the group is a graph of how the callee's arguments relate to
;;; the caller's parameters; closed under composition, every graph from a
;;; member to itself that is its own composition must have a parameter
;;; strictly smaller. The measures: parts (of sums, products, pairs at a
;;; `acyclic` region, datums), and integers counting down to a bound below or
;;; up to one above. A member named but not called escapes, and fails.

;; Its types, those it uses of the files before it, and the signatures of
;; what it is given.
