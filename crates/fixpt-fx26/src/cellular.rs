//! FX-26 compiled to cellular words, in Rust (PLAN.md, M13 step 13a): the
//! compiler written in FX-26 (`compile.fx`), decision for decision, over
//! the Rust checker's trees, so that the two make the same words and each
//! optimization can be written here first and checked end to end.
//!
//! The machine is `fixpt_engine::cellular`'s: a lambda's arguments are its
//! frame on the data stack, a `let`'s values are pushed onto the frame,
//! closures are flat, globals are cells, and a call in tail position is a
//! `tailcall`. A variable is resolved once: to a slot, a free value, a
//! global's cell, or, for `letrec`'s, a box in a slot or free value.
