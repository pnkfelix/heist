;;; The checker, in FX-26: higher kinds (`docs/research/higher-kinds.md`),
;;; the Rust checker's `kinds.rs`. Description functions, of arrow kinds
;;; `(=> (k1 … kn) k)`, made by `dlambda` and applied to descriptions: a
;;; `dlambda` applied is reduced (beta), one that only applies a function to
;;; its parameters is that function (eta), and a variable applied is an
;;; application, `ty-app`, equal only to one of the same function to equal
;;; descriptions. To an effect, an application is an atom, `a-app`.
;;; Reading them is `check-read-descs.fx`'s, with the rest of reading
;;; types. Part of the checker, `check-types.fx` first.
