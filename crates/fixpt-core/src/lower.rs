//! Lowering the Core IR into the heap.
//!
//! The Rust-side [`Program`] is a *compiler* representation: an arena, with
//! side tables the analysis passes fill in. What the engines execute is this —
//! the same program, encoded as ordinary heap objects.
//!
//! # Why it lives in the heap
//!
//! So that a dumped heap is self-contained. Larceny's interpreter survives a
//! heap dump because it is written in Scheme, which makes the structures it
//! interprets ordinary heap objects; an interpreter written in Rust over a Rust
//! arena would leave every closure pointing at something the image does not
//! contain. Putting the IR in the heap gets the same property by the same
//! means: a closure is `[code, env]`, `code` is a heap object, and everything
//! it refers to is reachable from it.
//!
//! # Encoding
//!
//! A `Code` object carries **one flat `Vector` of words** holding all of its
//! own nodes, and a node reference is a fixnum index into that vector. Not one
//! heap object per node: a flat vector is denser, is traced in one pass, and is
//! already most of the way to the bytecode the compiler will emit — so the two
//! engines end up sharing a code-object shape rather than reconciling two.
//!
//! Constants, symbols and nested `Code` objects sit inline as real `Value`s and
//! are traced automatically. Everything else is a fixnum, so the collector
//! walks the vector without needing to know the encoding at all.
//!
//! ```text
//! Const      [CONST, value]
//! Local      [LOCAL, depth, index, name]
//! Global     [GLOBAL, slot, name]
//! SetLocal   [SET_LOCAL, depth, index, name, expr]
//! SetGlobal  [SET_GLOBAL, slot, name, expr]
//! If         [IF, test, then, else]
//! Seq        [SEQ, n, e₀ … eₙ₋₁]
//! Let        [LET, n, body, init₀ … initₙ₋₁]
//! Fix        [FIX, n, body, init₀ … initₙ₋₁]
//! Lambda     [LAMBDA, code]
//! App        [APP, n, rator, rand₀ … randₙ₋₁]
//! ```
//!
//! Lexical addressing is baked into `Local`, which is what lets the separate
//! `Addressing` side table go away — it was Rust-side state that could not have
//! been dumped.
//!
//! Per-node source spans are deliberately *not* carried. Expansion-time errors
//! still have full spans, because the expander works on `Syntax` and runs
//! before lowering; what a run-time error needs is the procedure's name, and
//! that is on the `Code` object. Spans for every node would bloat every image
//! to pay for a message that is rarely better.
