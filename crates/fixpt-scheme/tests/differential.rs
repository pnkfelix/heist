//! The two engines must agree.
//!
//! This is the load-bearing test for the compiler. The AST engine is the one
//! that was conformance-checked against the reference implementations, so the
//! question for the bytecode engine is not "is it right" in the abstract but
//! "does it do what the checked engine does" — on values, on printed output,
//! and on error messages, which is where a compiler bug is most likely to hide
//! behind an answer that merely *looks* plausible.
//!
//! Each case runs in its own pair of sessions, so a case that corrupts state
//! cannot make a later one pass or fail spuriously.
