//! The code space: memory that holds machine code, mapped twice.
//!
//! One mapping is read+write and is where code (and the fields of a code
//! bloblet) are written; the other is read+execute and is where code runs from.
//! No address is ever both writable and executable, yet nothing is ever
//! re-protected either: a field can be written while its code runs, which is
//! exactly the "mutable fields, immutable suffix" bloblet the object model asks
//! for (`docs/object-model.md`, "What this machine allows"). The measurement
//! that chose this over `mprotect` and over `MAP_JIT` toggling is there too.
//!
//! The space does not move and does not grow: code addresses are baked into
//! other code and into return addresses, so a routine stays where it was put.
//! When one space fills, the caller makes another.
