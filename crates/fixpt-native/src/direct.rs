//! Code in the native convention (`docs/research/native-conventions.md`,
//! step 2): first-order procedures compiled from their register code to
//! machine code that calls by `bl` and returns by `ret`, with frames on a
//! stack of its own, and no ip, data stack, return entry or resume table.
//!
//! The convention, as the note has it, with register code's numbering:
//!
//! | what                 | where                                                      |
//! | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
//! | arguments            | `x1`–`x8` (register code's `REG1`…`REG8`)                  |
//! | result               | `x0` (`RESULT`)                                            |
//! | return address       | `x30`, saved in the frame by a procedure that has one      |
//! | frame link           | `x29`                                                      |
//! | the machine's state  | `x24`, pinned                                              |
//! | fuel                 | `x28`, pinned                                              |
//! | the stack's limit    | `x27`, pinned                                              |
//! | the closure called   | `x10`, as the call enters it; kept in the frame if read    |
//! | code's run address   | `x26`, pinned: a code bloblet's reference plus it          |
//! | values across a call | the frame's slots, from `[x29, #24]`: its values, the code  |
//! |                      | bloblet and the closure, then its raw `f64`s (`raw_slots`)  |
//! | the frame's stack map | `[x29, #16]`: a fixnum, the mask of the values traced, and |
//! |                      | its count of fields (`MAP_BITS`, `frame_shape`)            |
//! | the frame's header   | `[x29, #-8]`: room for its bloblet's header (`STUB_FRAME`)  |
//!
//! Every register but the pinned ones is the caller's to lose across a
//! call; register code already keeps whatever lives across one in its
//! frame. A procedure with no frame, no call and no loop (a leaf) checks
//! nothing: `(lambda ((x int)) x)` is `mov x0, x1; ret`. One with a frame
//! checks the stack's limit once, on entry, and fuel on entry; a loop
//! checks fuel on its back edge.
//!
//! What is compiled, for now: procedures that capture nothing, whose
//! register code keeps to arguments, immediate constants, registers and
//! frame slots, the integer operations register code does inline, pairs'
//! and bloblets' fields, branches, and calls of themselves or of other such
//! procedures named by globals. Anything else (a call-out, which may
//! collect; a closure made or read; a global read for its value) declines
//! the procedure, and whoever calls it. The collector never runs while
//! this code does, so no frame needs a stack map yet (step 3).
//!
//! A global called is bound when compiling: the code calls the procedure
//! the global held then. That is right for a program whose globals are
//! defined once, which is all this is used for until step 3 gives code
//! bloblets fields to keep their globals in.
