//! The native inner interpreter: the same cellular words the Rust bootstrap
//! interpreter runs (`fixpt_engine::cellular`), run by machine code written
//! into a code space with our own encoder.
//!
//! **Invariant: a word's code is position-independent.** It refers to
//! nothing outside itself by address: it reaches the machine's trap and
//! exit through the state (`ldr x16, [st, #trap]; br x16`), other words
//! through the table (`table[slot]`), and every branch it has stays inside
//! it; a saved ip is a cell's index, not an address. The only absolute
//! addresses of a word's code are outside it, where a move can rewrite
//! them: its slot's entry in the table, its table of where to resume, and
//! `CODE_OF_SLOT`. So code is moved by copying it, as collecting the code
//! does ([`NativeMachine::collect_code`]). The `far` that
//! [`assemble_word`] and [`assemble_register_word`] take is vestigial.
//! Keep any code generated here the same: an address it needs goes in a
//! table a move rewrites.
//!
//! One routine per routine number, each ending in its own copy of `NEXT`:
//!
//! ```text
//! NEXT:  ldr  x9, [ip], #-8      ; the cell; cells run toward higher k
//!        tst  x9, #7             ; a fixnum names a primitive
//!        b.ne 1f
//!        ldr  x10, [table, x9]   ; n<<3 is already the byte offset
//!        br   x10
//!    1:  add  x11, base, x9      ; a word: suffix + 4
//!        ldur x10, [x11, #-20]   ; its entry, a fixnum routine number
//!        ldr  x10, [table, x10]
//!        br   x10
//! ```
//!
//! The machine keeps its registers across routines, and saves them in a
//! [`State`] whenever it leaves machine code: to return, or to call into Rust
//! for what allocates (`cons`) or is rare (`field!`, and `field@` on a
//! bloblet with no trailer). There the Rust side sees both stacks as slices
//! of Values, the roots they are, and may collect. Afterwards the machine
//! reloads everything, the heap's base included, since a collection moves it.
//!
//! The ip is kept as an address while running and as the fixnum `k` of the
//! next cell (`8k` bytes before the current word's suffix, which is the same
//! bits) whenever it is saved, so it survives the word moving.
//!
//! What the machine checks, and where: types and overflow in every primitive;
//! fuel and stack limits where a word is entered and where a branch is taken,
//! the only ways to run longer than one word's straight-line code. Past the
//! limits each stack has a word's worth of room, then a guard region, so a
//! word that pushes or pops past its stack faults instead of corrupting
//! memory. That is the one difference from the Rust machine, which reports
//! underflow as a trap.
