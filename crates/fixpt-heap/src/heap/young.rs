//! The nursery, and what lets it be collected alone
//! (`docs/research/generational-gc.md`): the card table, the old space's
//! crossing map, and minor collections.
//!
//! A generational heap allocates everything in the nursery. A minor
//! collection copies what is live there to the end of the old semispace
//! (the active one), Cheney's way, and empties it: everything live is
//! promoted at once. Its roots are the usual ones, what the regions hold
//! (scanned whole), and the dirty cards of the old space and the code area:
//! a store that puts a young reference into either marks the card of the
//! word written (`Heap::set_slot`, and each machine's own stores).
