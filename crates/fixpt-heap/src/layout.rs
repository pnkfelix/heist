//! The object layout, specified once.
//!
//! Everything about how a value and a heap object are laid out in words — the
//! tags, the header's bit fields, the kinds — is a table here, and nowhere else.
//! `value.rs` and `heap.rs` are written against these constants, and the FX-26
//! side's copy, `crates/fixpt-fx26/src/layout.fx`, is *generated* from the same
//! table by [`fx26_module`], with a test that the checked-in file is what the
//! generator produces. So the two languages cannot drift apart: changing the
//! layout means changing this file, regenerating, and committing both.
//!
//! The design is `docs/object-model.md`. The short version: a heap object is a
//! **bloblet** — a header, `F` tagged fields, and `B` bytes of untraced suffix —
//! and the collector needs only `F` and `B` to trace it, never its kind.
