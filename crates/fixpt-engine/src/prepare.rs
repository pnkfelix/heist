//! Getting a program ready to run.
//!
//! With the Core IR in the heap this is almost nothing: lower the analysed
//! [`Program`] into a `Code` object, wrap it in a closure, and keep a root to
//! it. There is no addressing side table any more — lexical addresses are baked
//! into the lowered nodes — and no constant pool to remember to trace, since
//! constants sit inline in the node vector.
//!
//! That is the point of the whole arrangement: after this runs, *nothing the
//! engine executes lives in Rust*, so the heap can be dumped and resumed.
