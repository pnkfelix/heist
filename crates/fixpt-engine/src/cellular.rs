//! Cellular code: Forth's execution model over bloblets, and the Rust
//! bootstrap inner interpreter that runs it. ("Cellular" would be called
//! "threaded" in the Forth community: code as a sequence of cells,
//! references to routines and their operands, run by an inner interpreter.
//! This repository says "cellular" throughout.)
//!
//! A cellular word is a bloblet whose fields are its program (the layout is
//! `layout::cellular`). This interpreter reads words directly from the heap
//! and is the oracle for the native inner interpreters in `fixpt-native`,
//! which run the same words. The machine is a data stack of Values; a
//! frame pointer, where the running closure's frame (its arguments, then
//! its locals) begins on the data stack; the running closure, whose free
//! values are copied in (flat closures); and a return stack of
//! `(word, fixnum k, fixnum frame pointer, closure)` entries. Every one of
//! those is a Value, so both stacks are roots as they stand. The design
//! for code compiled from FX-26 follows the MacScheme machine's (Larceny's
//! `doc/LarcenyNotes/note13-malcode.html`), on a stack.
//!
//! Every word is made by `Heap::make_cellular_word`, which checks each cell
//! and operand, and published with its fields frozen, so a cell is always a
//! routine's number or a word. The native machines rely on that: they run a
//! cell without looking at it twice.
