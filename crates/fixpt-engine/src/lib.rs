//! `fixpt-engine` — execution.
//!
//! Two engines over one Core IR and one runtime:
//!
//! * [`interp`] walks the heap-resident Core IR with an explicit control stack.
//! * [`vm`] runs bytecode that [`compile`] emits from the same IR.
//!
//! Both execute code that lives *in the heap*, so a dumped image can be resumed
//! by either — nothing they run is held in Rust.
//!
//! Both are explicit-stack machines with the same calling convention, so proper
//! tail calls, unbounded recursion depth and re-entrant `call/cc` hold in both,
//! and the conformance suite can require that they agree on every case.
