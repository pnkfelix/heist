//! Checking a form while it is still being typed.
//!
//! The FX dialects can say a great deal about a form before it runs — its type
//! and effect — and the checkers are pure Rust, so asking costs nothing anyone
//! could notice. This module turns half-typed text into something a checker
//! can be asked about, and decides which of its complaints to believe.
//!
//! **Closing off.** An unfinished form is closed with the delimiters it is
//! missing, and a token still being typed at the end — `vec` on the way to
//! `vector-ref`, an unterminated string — is left out, so that the checker
//! never sees a half-typed name. What is left is a complete form made of
//! exactly what has been finished.
//!
//! **Believing errors.** Closing off manufactures errors of its own: `(if`
//! becomes `(if)`, which has no test. So an error is reported only when its
//! span lies wholly inside what was typed *and* contains none of the lists
//! that were closed off here — that is, when it is about a subform the user
//! has already finished. `(+ 1 (car 5)` reports `(car 5)` at once; the outer
//! `+`, still open, is not judged.
//!
//! **The hole at the cursor.** The innermost open list, with a `,help` hole
//! where the next argument goes, is what the static `,help` already answers —
//! so the answer can be shown continuously, as a hint, instead of on request.
