//! Asking the REPL what to do next.
//!
//! Ordinary REPL help is a list of names and a paragraph each, written by hand
//! and out of date by the second release. This one asks the running system,
//! which already knows more than a manual would: the Scheme side has the
//! primitive table, and the FX front ends have a *type* for every binding in
//! their standard environment, generated from the 1987 and 1991 sources.
//!
//! That makes one question answerable that a REPL usually cannot answer at all:
//!
//! ```text
//! fx87> ,fits (pairof int bool @=)
//! ```
//!
//! — *I have one of these; what accepts it?* The environment carries a type for
//! every name and [`subtype`](fixpt_fx87::subtype) decides the rest, so the
//! answer is a search rather than a guess. Polymorphic bindings are matched
//! with their binders left as unknowns, exactly as implicit projection does at
//! a real call site, so `car` is found without anyone having to instantiate it
//! first.
//!
//! A hole — `,help` written *inside* a form — is answered twice, because there
//! are two different things to know and neither subsumes the other.
//!
//! *Statically*, from the types: the hole is one argument of one subroutine,
//! and the arguments already written often pin down what the rest must be, so
//! FX can say `the hole wants: int` and then list what produces one.
//!
//! *Dynamically*, by running the program: the form is evaluated as written
//! except at the hole, which becomes `(%hole POSITION TOTAL)` — a primitive
//! that reports the machine's pending work instead of computing. That answer is
//! made of values rather than types (`#(0 0 0)`, not `(vectorof int r)`), it
//! notices things no type can (the branch that means the hole is never reached
//! at all), and it is the *only* answer available in Scheme, which has no types
//! to consult.
//!
//! In Scheme the hole is also *held*: reaching it captures the rest of the
//! form as a composable continuation, delimited by the top level's prompt, so
//! `,resume EXPR` carries on from the hole with a value — as many times as you
//! like, which is how a candidate from the static half gets tried.
//!
//! The dynamic half costs something the static half does not: evaluating an
//! argument the user only asked *about*. In FX that cost is priced by the
//! effect system — an argument is run only when its inferred effect says no one
//! could tell, and otherwise the effect itself is reported. So the static
//! analysis is what licenses the dynamic one.
//!
//! The commands are the same in every dialect; what each can answer differs,
//! and a dialect that cannot answer one says so rather than staying silent.
