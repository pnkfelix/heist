//! Reading a form from a person, as opposed to from a pipe.
//!
//! Both REPLs read through [`LineReader`], which picks its implementation by
//! asking whether stdin is a terminal:
//!
//! * **[`raw`]** — our own editor: arrow keys, `^A`/`^E`/`^K`/`^U`/`^W`,
//!   history that persists across sessions, and editing that works *across* the
//!   lines of an unfinished form.
//! * **Plain** — `read_line`, for a pipe or a file. Not a degraded mode but the
//!   correct one: writing cursor-movement escapes into a redirected stdout
//!   would corrupt it, and the test suite drives both REPLs through pipes.
//!
//! A REPL reads *forms*, not lines, so the multi-line rule lives here: `Enter`
//! submits when the form is balanced and inserts a newline when it is not. The
//! buffer being edited is the whole form, so you can arrow back up into the
//! first line of a `define` and fix it before submitting, and the form enters
//! history as one entry rather than as three fragments.
//!
//! # Why no line-editing crate
//!
//! `rustyline` would bring fifteen transitive crates, including `nix` and
//! `libc`, into a binary that has no external dependencies at all — and
//! `fixpt build` appends a heap image to a copy of this executable, so every
//! shipped program would carry a line editor it can never use.
//!
//! The one thing that genuinely needs the C library is putting the terminal in
//! raw mode, and the workspace denies `unsafe_code`. So [`raw::RawMode`] shells
//! out to `stty`, saving the old settings and restoring them on `Drop`. That is
//! a real wart, and it is the price of the property above.
//!
//! What we give up by not using a library: reverse search (`^R`), bracketed
//! paste, correct redrawing of lines longer than the terminal is wide, and
//! Windows. Each is additive if it turns out to matter.

/// * **an identifier that is not bound**, dimmed — so a typo is visible at the
///   keystroke that makes it, rather than after `Enter`. The list of bound
///   names is the same one `Tab` completes from;
/// * **the matching delimiter** for the one under the cursor, brightened;
/// * **strings, characters, numbers and comments**, so the shape of a form is
///   readable.
///
/// All of it comes from [`fixpt_read::tokens`] rather than from a scan written
/// here. That is the same discipline `form_status` imposed and for the same
/// reason: a `)` inside `#| … |#` or `|a(b|` is not a delimiter, and a
/// highlighter that decided otherwise would brighten the wrong one.
///
/// Cursor arithmetic is unaffected by any of this, because `render` computes
/// the cursor's position from the *logical* buffer and never from the string it
/// draws — a separation that was already there and is what makes colour nearly
