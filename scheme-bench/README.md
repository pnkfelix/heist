# scheme-bench: Larceny's R7RS benchmarks in FX-26

Reference points, not part of the per-commit `fixpt bench`: Larceny's R7RS
benchmarks (`test/Benchmarking/R7RS/` in Larceny's tree), ported to FX-26.
Each `NAME.fx` runs the benchmark at Larceny's own inputs and iteration
count, and its last form's value is the answer Larceny checks. How a port
is made, and what it may change, is in `PORTING.md`; each file's header
says what its port changed and why.

To run one as machine code:

```
fixpt eval --step-limit none scheme-bench/NAME.fx   # on the fastest machine here
```

## Ported: 53 of 75

Every port passes both checkers, gives Larceny's answer natively, and
agrees with the program lowered to Scheme (at smaller counts where the
full one takes long). Times are one native run each, alone, on
2026-09-29 (`pi` and `chudnovsky` on 2026-09-30), wall clock including
about 1.8 s of start-up (reading, checking and compiling the program), or
2.7 s for `pi` and `chudnovsky`. Start-up is about 0.5 s since 2026-09-30
(the front end's checker and compilers are no longer also loaded
lowered): `pi` now takes 0.6 s in all.

## Not ported: 22

Each needs something FX-26 does not have, at its core (not as a tool the
port could carry itself):

Floats would unblock the most: 12 need them, and 7 of those
(`fibfp`, `sumfp`, `fft`, `mbrot`, `nucleic`, `simplex`, `pnpoly`) need
nothing else. Then a file input port with `read-char`, which alone
unblocks `wc`, `bibfreq`, `bibfreq2` and `charset`. The identity test
(`eq?`) came on 2026-09-30: `equal` and `dynamic` are ported, and the
workarounds in `browse`, `conform`, `maze` and `sboyer` are gone.
(Bignums, which blocked `pi` and `chudnovsky`, came to `int` on 2026-09-30.) See
`docs/research/floats.md`.
