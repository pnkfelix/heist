# Declared conventions: code a program makes, under a contract it states

Kayak's request (2026-10-14, `TODO.md` §97): kayak is writing FX-26's
native code generators in KFX, which may use only what FX-26 has, and
FX-26 has no way to place machine code a program made and run it. This
note designs that, and the contract the code must keep, so that the same
machine code runs on fixpt's machines and on kayak's runtime.

The user's direction (2026-10-14): not leaf code only, and the contract
*declared*: a convention is a description that means something, not a
version number, even if, at first, the declarations an implementation
accepts are a fixed set.

## What a program does

1. **Make a bloblet** as any other (`make-bloblet`): its fields, traced, and
   a suffix of so many bytes.
2. **Fill it**: its fields with any values, its suffix with the machine
   code, by the suffix writes bloblets already have.
3. **Seal it** (`seal-code`): a copy in the code area (`docs/object-model.md`,
   "A collected code area"), its fields, trailer and suffix as the
   bloblet's, the suffix frozen (the header's bit 13, past which a suffix
   write already fails) and flushed from the instruction cache. A copy,
   not the bloblet itself, so that a bloblet is made, written and typed as
   every other is, and the code area holds only code that is finished.
4. **Make a procedure of it** (`native-procedure`), at a convention and a
   type the program states. This is the step that is trusted: nothing
   checks that machine code keeps a type, or a convention, so it carries an
   effect of its own, `(io native)`, and every use of the power shows in
   effects.
5. **Ask first** (`native-code?`) whether this machine runs native code at
   all, and fall back to interpretation where it does not.

The procedure made is a first-class FX-26 procedure, a native closure of
the code bloblet over nothing: every machine calls native closures
already (the cellular ones through the Rust machine, `TODO.md` §93), so a
call of it needs nothing new. Its code bloblet is one of the code area's,
collected as fixpt's own are: never moved, mark-swept, its fields traced
and updated in place, alive while the closure, or a frame running it, is.

## The operations (built 2026-10-14)

Standard operations, not syntax: a code bloblet is a bloblet, made and
written by the bloblet forms (`docs/fx26.md`, "Bloblets"), and the type a
procedure of it has is given by `the`:

| operation          | type                                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `seal-code`        | `(poly ((a type)) (subr (io native) (a) a))`          |
| `native-procedure` | `(poly ((a type) (t type)) (subr (io native) (a) t))` |
| `native-code?`     | `(subr pure () bool)`                                 |

```scheme
(the (subr (conv native) pure (int int) int) (native-procedure (seal-code b)))
```

- `seal-code` takes a bloblet the program made (kind `bloblet`, an ordinary
  header) and gives its sealed copy, of the same type: its fields stay
  mutable if they were, and the collector updates them in place.
- `native-procedure` checks, at run time, that its argument is a sealed
  copy (in the code area, its suffix frozen), else a failure, not a crash,
  and makes a native closure of it over nothing. Its type is `t`, whatever
  `the` says (the trust `(io native)` marks), but for its convention: both
  checkers require a procedure type of the native convention (`(conv
  native)`, or a name `define-convention` bound to it) or `fx`, and refuse
  any other, the program's own `cellular` among them (a convention left
  out is the program's), rather than convert the closure: an adapter to
  the cellular convention runs on only some machines today. Like `cwcc`,
  it is named only as a call's operator.
- `native-code?` is false where native procedures cannot be made (the
  evaluator written in FX-26, whose values are its own), where both other
  operations fail.
- `(io native)` is the tenth member of the `io` family.
- `(define-convention C clause …)`, at top level, binds `C` to a supported
  declaration (step 4, below).

## A convention, declared

A convention is a set of *clauses*, each binding a *role* to where it is,
or to the protocol it follows. The roles, and what each clause's head
means, are defined by this note and, once settled, by `docs/fx26.md`; the
parameters are data. Two declarations whose normal forms are equal are the
same convention. Nothing in a declaration is a version: a change to the
convention is a change to some clause, and says what changed.

```scheme
(define-convention native
  (target arm64)
  (registers
    (arguments x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8)
    (count x9)                       ; arguments given, for a variadic callee
    (result x0)
    (closure x10)
    (link x30)
    (frame x29)
    (pinned (state x24) (fuel x28) (stack-limit x27) (code-distance x26))
    (scratch x9 x11 x12 x13 x14 x15 x16 x17))
  (values …)                         ; the layout: tags, headers, kinds
  (closures …)                       ; a native closure's fields
  (code …)                           ; a code bloblet: its fields, its entry
  (frames …)                         ; their layout, their stack maps
  (state …)                          ; the fields code reads and writes
  (routines …)                       ; what the runtime does for code
  (fuel …)
  (barrier …))
```

### The clauses, as fixpt's `native` has them

Taken from `crates/fixpt-native/src/direct.rs` (its header comment is the
table) and `crates/fixpt-heap/src/layout.rs`.

- **`target`**: `arm64`, the AArch64 instruction set, little-endian.
- **`registers`**: arguments in `x1`–`x8` (past eight, the eighth a list of
  the rest), their count in `x9` on entry, the result in `x0`, the closure
  called in `x10`, the return address in `x30`, the frame link in `x29`.
  Pinned, never changed by code but as the clause on fuel says: the
  machine's state `x24`, fuel `x28`, the native stack's limit `x27`, and
  the distance from a code bloblet's reference to where its code runs
  `x26`. Every other register is the callee's to lose; nothing that is a
  value is kept in a register across a call or a routine that may collect.
- **`values`**: the tags (`fixnum` `000`, 61 bits signed; the bloblet
  pointer `100`, at its suffix; the suffix ref `010`; the header `110`; …),
  the header's fields (kind, large, fields frozen, suffix frozen, *F*,
  *B*), the immediates (`#t`, `#f`, `'()`, `#u`, characters), and the
  kinds' numbers, as `layout.rs` has them.
- **`closures`**: a native closure is a bloblet of kind `native-closure`,
  field 0 its code bloblet (`CLOSURE_WORD`), its captured values after
  (`CLOSURE_FREE0`); its code is native code when that field is at or
  past the code area's start (the state's `code-lo`), else the callee is
  called through the `foreign` routine.
- **`code`**: a code bloblet's code runs at its reference plus `x26`; field
  *k* is `8k + 4` bytes before its first instruction, read PC-relatively.
- **`frames`**: the frame's region from `x29 − 8`: a header word's room,
  the link `[x29]`, the return `[x29 + 8]`, the stack map `[x29 + 16]` (a
  fixnum: the count of fields above bit 48, the live values' mask below;
  negative, minus the count, when every value is live), values from
  `[x29 + 24]`, raw words after, 16-byte aligned. A frame keeps its code
  bloblet in a value slot, so that code running is alive. The stack map
  is stored before every call and every routine that may collect.
- **`state`**: the fields of the state at `x24` that code reads or writes,
  each by name and offset: fuel's reserve, the allocation top, the heap's
  base and the allocation limit, the arguments of a routine, the trap,
  the card table, `code-lo`, and the routines' entries.
- **`routines`**: what the runtime does for code, each a routine whose
  entry is in a state field, called by `blr` with its inputs, outputs and
  what it loses declared: call what is not native code (`foreign`),
  allocate (`cons`, `bloblet`), fail (the trap, its kind in `x9`), poll
  (a time slice spent), overflow (a frame past the stack's limit). No
  routine makes a closure: one with captured values is to come from
  `native-procedure` given them, reached through a field (`TODO.md` §97).
  No routine calls a
  primitive by number, as fixpt's own code does: a number is fixpt's
  alone. Made code reaches a primitive as it reaches any procedure, a
  value in a field of its code bloblet that the program put there when it
  made the code (see "Primitives, through fields").
  Routines, not inline sequences, are the contract wherever fixpt's own
  code has a sequence too intricate to standardise (a poll's is thirty
  instructions): the sequence lives in the runtime, once, and a declared
  routine stays the same while the runtime's inside changes.
- **`fuel`**: decremented in `x28` on entry to a procedure that calls and
  on a loop's back edge; at zero, the `poll` routine.
- **`barrier`**: a store of a value into a heap object marks the byte for
  its card, `cards + (address >> 9)` (a card is 64 words), the biased
  table's address in the state.

### Accepted, or refused

A program's declaration is normalised (clauses sorted by role, each
clause's own parameters in their order) and compared with the
implementation's *supported set*. Equal to one, it is that convention:
`native ≤ fx` holds of it, and its procedures are called as any native
closure is. Equal to none, the program is refused at the declaration,
naming the first clause that differs from the nearest one supported
("`frames`: the stack map declared at `[x29 + 16]`; this implementation
keeps it at …"), or the clause missing or not known.

For the first deliverable the supported set is one declaration: fixpt's
`native`, as it is. Later, an implementation may support more than one, an
older declaration among them, with the conversions the checker already
inserts between conventions (`docs/research/native-conventions.md`,
"Conventions in types").

### Generated, so that it cannot drift

fixpt's declaration is generated from the implementation's own tables
(`layout.rs`'s tags, kinds and header fields; `DState`'s offsets by
`offset_of!`; `direct.rs`'s registers, frame constants and routines; the
card shift), as `standard.fx` is generated from `lower.rs`'s table, into a
file, `crates/fixpt-runtime/src/native-arm64.conv` (one clause to a line,
canonical; `fixpt_runtime::NATIVE_CONVENTION`; on x86_64,
`native-x86_64.conv`, the same roles, its registers and places in the
state x86_64's, 2026-10-18), and a test
(`fixpt-native/tests/convention.rs`) compares the file with what the
tables say now (`FIXPT_BLESS=1` to
rewrite). Both checkers compare a program's declaration with it: the Rust
one reads it with `include_str!`, the one written in FX-26 from a
the same text, which a program reads too, one clause to a string, by the
standard operation `native-convention`. A change to the convention is a change to that file, in the
same commit, and a program written against the old one is refused with
the difference, not run.

### Primitives, through fields

Made code needs no names nor numbers for the runtime's primitives. A
primitive is a procedure value in FX-26 (`*`, `string-append`); the program
that makes the code puts the ones it calls in the code bloblet's fields,
which the code reads PC-relatively and calls as any procedure: native code
directly, anything else by `foreign`. The program names them in FX-26, the
checker types them, and the fields keep them alive: linking through the
object, not a table. (2026-10-15; test `programs/made-code/linked.fx`.)

### Data a generator reads

The declaration is also data: a generator written in FX-26 reads the
registers, offsets and routines' entries from it, rather than from numbers
copied out of fixpt, so kayak's generators are parametric in the
convention they emit for. A `convention` (`fx26:convention.fx`, step 6) is
that data; the rules a declaration states besides its numbers (nothing
kept across a call but the pinned registers, the map stored before every
call, …) are what a `convention` means, and one that states other rules
is refused when read. Kayak's runtime publishes its own supported set,
and where the two meet, the same code runs on both.

## Where the trust is

`(io native)` marks the one trusted step: a procedure made of machine code
at a stated type and convention. The declaration does not make machine
code safe; it makes the contract the code was written to explicit,
checkable for agreement, and the same on both sides. A capability, held
rather than declared, can come later as a handle over the same primitive,
for a program that must hand the power on.

## Not yet

- **Heap images** carry no code area yet, so making an image of a program
  that holds a code bloblet is refused until they do (`docs/object-model.md`,
  "Not yet decided").
- **Other targets**: only `arm64`. A declaration for another target is
  refused, by its `target` clause.
- **A faster call of a procedure value**: made code calls a primitive
  through `foreign`, the general path, where fixpt's own code calls its
  primitives more directly. A routine for it, if made code needs the
  speed, still takes the procedure, not a number.

## Steps, each committed and tested

1. This note.
2. and 3. *(Done 2026-10-14.)* `seal-code` (`Heap::seal_code_copy`),
   `native-procedure`, `native-code?` and `(io native)`, in both checkers'
   tables, the lowering, the runtime and the evaluator written in FX-26;
   the bytecode VM calls a native closure as it calls a primitive, and
   the stencils' typed call checks for one, as the other arm64 machines'
   do since `TODO.md` §93 (it crashed). Tests: `programs/made-code/
   leaves.fx`, a leaf adding two fixnums and one returning its own field
   across collections, on all nine machines (`fixpt-cli/tests/
   made_code.rs`; the evaluator falls back); `fixpt-native/tests/
   code_exec.rs`, `a_sealed_copy_runs_and_reads_its_field`.
4. *(Done 2026-10-14.)* `define-convention`: fixpt's declaration
   generated (`fixpt_native::direct::native_convention`, `direct/
   declare.rs`) and blessed; both checkers compare a program's with it
   (`convention.rs`; `check-program.fx`, `k-check-convention`), the same
   refusals at the same places, and bind its name to `native`; a program
   reads the clauses by `native-convention`. Clauses are compared as
   printed canonically (atoms apart by one space, integers in decimal),
   sorted by role: the first role, in that order, that differs is the
   refusal's (a clause not the implementation's, one it has not, one it
   has that the program left out, two of one role, an atom not a name nor
   an integer). Tests: `checker.rs`, `declared_conventions_alike`;
   `programs/made-code/declared.fx` on all nine machines.
5. *(Done 2026-10-14.)* Code that is not a leaf. Two routines for it, at
   state fields as `foreign` is, where fixpt's own code has inline
   sequences or bare call-outs: `poll` (`common_poll`: a stub's frame, the
   next slice or the trap for fuel spent, the scheduler's `preempt` if
   due) and `cons` (`common_cons`, call-out 8, which may collect). The
   declaration gained them, `overflow` (the stack's limit, as fixpt's own
   entries meet it), `fuel`, and a stack map stated in full: bit `k`
   below 48 value slot `k` live, above it the frame's fields (link,
   return, map and the value slots), negative for all live. A program's
   code finds its own code bloblet in its closure (field 2), so it needs
   no `adr`. Test: `programs/made-code/frames.fx`, 51 instructions (made by
   the encoder written in FX-26, `fx26:arm64.fx`): a frame of four value
   slots, a million pairs by `cons` across collections, `poll` on the
   loop's back edge, a call of the procedure it is given (native, or
   cellular by `foreign`), and the same made at every depth of a
   recursion 3000 deep; on all nine machines, and stressed (time slices
   of 3, a small nursery, a small stack cache, where the made code's own
   entry passes the limit 39 times). Not on the bytecode VM, which cannot
   be called back. Later (2026-10-15) a third routine, `bloblet`
   (`common_bloblet`, call-out 9, which may collect): a plain bloblet of
   the bytes in `x1` and the fields in `x2`, as `%make-bloblet-filled`
   makes it, zeroed, or the trap for sizes that refuses. Test:
   `programs/made-code/allocated.fx`, made from a `convention`: two
   fields stored, each store marking its card, twenty thousand kept
   across collections, a size of -1 refused.
6. *(Done 2026-10-15.)* Data a generator reads: the declaration as a
   value of FX-26. `(load-input "fx26:convention.fx")` reads the clauses
   `native-convention` gives (or any in that canonical form) into a
   `convention` (`convention-types.fx`), a product of products: registers
   by number, the state's fields by name and offset, each routine's
   entry, inputs and output, the frame's offsets, the values' tags and
   kinds. Reading is total, then the value is printed back, and a
   declaration it does not print back to, clause for clause, is refused
   at the first that differs, so that nothing a `convention` cannot hold
   is dropped unseen. Test: `programs/made-code/generated.fx`, step 5's
   procedure made from a `convention` by the encoder written in FX-26,
   word for word the code `frames.fx` writes out, on all nine machines.
